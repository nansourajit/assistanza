‘+ We start with the invention. We take early stage ideas and tum
‘them into demos —not technical demos but conceptual ones,
like the rough version of Flare you saw.

‘+ Then our team takes this seed of an idea to customers, in
conferences and forums, to get feedback that helps us shape it
into something even more useful.

‘+ We improve it and buld a prototype that we give to a set of
‘early adopters, who use itand give us more feedback.

‘+ Eventual, after a few quick cycles ofthis process, we
standardze the product features.

‘+ Only then is it ready to go out to our larger group of customers,
like the frished version of Flare you saw.
